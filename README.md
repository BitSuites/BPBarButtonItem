DEPRECATED BPBarButtonItem
===============

NOTE - This code has been deperecated since it isn't applicable to apps built for iOS 7 and after.

BPBarButtonItem is a tool for making awesome looking custom UIBarButtonItems on the fly. BPBarButtonItem is *NOT* a subclass of `UIBarButtonItem` but an `NSObject` which creates skinned plain `UIBarButtonItem`s for use however you want. BPBarButtonItem can also be used to skin `UIBarButtonItem`s which have already been created, like in a nib or Storyboard. Generated buttons have support for both orientation styles, and automatically show up properly for back buttons.

## Installation

### From [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=bpbarbuttonitem)

	pod 'BPBarButtonItem'

### From Source

* Drag the `BPBarButtonItem/` folder to your project (make sure you copy all files/folders)
* `#import "BPBarButtonItem.h"`

## How to Use

There are 3 main ways to use BPBarButtonItem:

### Creating a brand new button in code

This will allow you to create a brand new `UIBarButtonItem` on the fly. You can use any of the predefined styles or set your own tint color.

````objective-c
self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [BPBarButtonItem barButtonItemWithStyle:BPBarButtonItemStyleAction title:@"Action" target:self  action:@selector(buttonAction:)];
````
```objective-c
self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [BPBarButtonItem barButtonItemWithTintColor:[UIColor redColor] title:@"Red" target:self action:@selector(buttonAction:)];
```

### Styling an existing button (often from a nib or Storyboard)

This will style any existing `UIBarButtonItem`. The title, action, and any other attributes are not modified. This works from an `IBOutlet` or by accessing the `navigationItem`'s right and left button properties directly.

```objective-c
[BPBarButtonItem customizeBarButtonItem:self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem withStyle:BPBarButtonItemStyleStandardDark];
```
```objective-c
[BPBarButtonItem customizeBarButtonItem:self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem withTintColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:0.048 green:0.169 blue:0.458 alpha:1.000]];
```

### Styling ALL the buttons using an Appearance Proxy

Want to style all the buttons in your app to be consistent, but don't want to set them all individually? Setting the default button style is almost identical to styling an existing button, except you pass in `nil` for the button item. You'll generally want to do this as part of your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

```objective-c
[BPBarButtonItem customizeBarButtonItem:nil withStyle:BPBarButtonItemStyleStandardDark];
```

Note that with the Appearance Proxy method, you can still override individual buttons using the existing button styling method above.

You can also get complex and pass in a specific Appearance Proxy as well. For example, this may be used to stylize buttons in a `UINavigationBar` but not those in a `UIToolbar`.

```objective-c
[BPBarButtonItem customizeBarButtonItem:[UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn:[UINavigationBar class], nil] withStyle:BPBarButtonItemStyleStandardLight];
```

### Styling Segmented Controls

You can style a `UISegmentedControl` directly or using an Appearance Proxy. The syntax is similar to UIBarButtonItems as shown above.

```objective-c
[BPBarButtonItem customizeSegmentedControl:mySegmentedControl withStyle:BPBarButtonItemStyleStandardDark];
```

```objective-c
[BPBarButtonItem customizeSegmentedControl:nil withStyle:BPBarButtonItemStyleStandardDark];
```

## Things BPBarButtonItem Can't Do

BPBarButtonItem makes standard, plain-old `UIBarButtonItem`s, and as such they have the same limitations. You can't use them outside of a navigation bar or a toolbar. If you're looking for a nicely styled `UIButton` alternative, check out [BButton](https://github.com/mattlawer/BButton).
